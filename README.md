Project Title: Employee Management System

Technologies Used:
Frontend: ASP.NET MVC
Backend: C#, .NET
Database: SQL Server
ORM: Entity Framework (DB First Approach)
Authentication: Token-based authentication (using OAuth and OWIN Middleware)
Tools: Visual Studio, ADO.NET, Entity Framework

1. Project Overview:
The Employee Management System is a web application developed using ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, and Entity Framework with a database-first approach. The system provides essential features to manage employees, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Additionally, the application is secured using token-based authentication to ensure that only authenticated users can access the API.

2.Features:
a. CRUD Operations for Employee Management:
.Add Employee: Users can add new employee records to the database.
.Update Employee: Users can update existing employee information.
.Delete Employee: Users can remove employee records from the system.
.View Employee: The system allows users to view a list of all employees or individual employee details.

b. Token-Based Authentication:
To secure the APIs, token-based authentication has been implemented. The system authenticates users and issues a token upon successful login, which is required for accessing secured API endpoints.

3. Implementation Details:
a. Database Creation:

. Created the Employee table and other necessary database structures in SQL Server.
. Followed Entity Framework DB First approach, where the database was designed first, and then models were generated using the ADO.NET Entity Data Model.
. The application interacts with the database using Entity Framework for efficient data management.

b. ADO.NET Entity Framework Integration:
. Created models by reverse engineering the SQL Server database using the Entity Framework DB First approach.
. Implemented CRUD APIs for employee management based on the generated models.

c. Token-Based Authentication Setup:
1. Set Up OWIN Middleware: Configured OWIN Middleware for handling authentication. This provides a flexible way to manage authentication flows.
2. Create the Startup.cs Class: The Startup.cs class is responsible for configuring OWIN middleware and enabling OAuth authentication. This setup helps generate access tokens for authenticated users.
3. Create the AuthorizationServerProvider.cs Class: This class contains the logic for authenticating users. For simplicity, credentials are hardcoded for testing purposes.
4. Create the WebApiConfig.cs Class (API Configuration): The WebApiConfig.cs file in the App_Start folder is used to configure Web API routing and other setting

d. Testing Token Generation: 
. For development purposes, the credentials are hardcoded in the AuthorizationServerProvider.cs class.
. A token can be generated by making a POST request to /token with valid credentials.

4. How Token-Based Authentication Works:
1. The client application sends a request to the token endpoint (/token) with user credentials.
2. If the credentials are valid, an access token is generated and returned to the client.
3. The client uses this token to access protected API endpoints, including those related to employee management.
4. The token is validated on each request to ensure that the user is authenticated.

5. Future Improvements:
. Replace hardcoded credentials with dynamic user management and validation from the database.
. Implement role-based authorization for more granular access control (e.g., admin vs. regular users).
. Add unit and integration testing to ensure the reliability of the CRUD and authentication features.

6. Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the development of a basic Employee Management System using ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, Entity Framework (DB First), and token-based authentication with OAuth. The system allows for efficient management of employee data while ensuring secure access to the applicationâ€™s resources through tokens.
